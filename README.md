# Brimstone Chat

Real time chat app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Intalling / Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend. Credit to [react-moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment) for timestamp support. The backend uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for rapid prototyping and real time chat updates.

### Server setup

Fork and/or clone the repository, then reach out to me directly for a copy of the missing `firebase.js` file needed to interact with the server.

### Frontend setup

Once you receive the firebase file, drop it into the `src` directory then make sure to `cd` to the top level of the repository and run:
```
npm install && npm start
```
to get dependencies installed locally and have it running on your local host. Because it is a Create-React app this will automatically open a browser window pointing to the frontend and you will be able to interact from there.
