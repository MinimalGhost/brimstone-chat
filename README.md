# Brimstone Chat

Real time chat app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend. Credit to [react-moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment) for timestamp support. The backend uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for rapid prototyping and real time chat updates. Live demo can be found [here](https://brimstone-198721.firebaseapp.com).
